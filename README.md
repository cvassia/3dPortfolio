# 3D Portfolio ✨

An interactive **3D portfolio website** built with **React** and modern WebGL tooling, showcasing creative frontend development with a strong focus on visual storytelling, performance, and user experience.

🔗 **Live site:** https://www.cvassia.com  
👩‍💻 **Author:** Vassia Christopoulou.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a personal portfolio designed to explore the intersection of **frontend engineering, 3D graphics, and design**.  
It presents selected work and experiments through immersive 3D scenes, smooth animations, and responsive layouts.

The site reflects my background in **architecture and set design**, translated into digital space through interactive interfaces.

## Architecture

- Component-driven React architecture
- Separation of UI components and 3D canvas logic
- Declarative scene composition using @react-three/fiber
- Reusable helpers via @react-three/drei
- Stateless visual components where possible

---

## Rendering & Performance

- WebGL rendering via Three.js
- Scene graph managed by React Three Fiber
- Optimized re-renders using hooks and memoization
- Lazy loading of assets where applicable
- Responsive camera scaling for different viewports


---

## ✨ Features

- Interactive 3D scenes rendered with WebGL
- Smooth camera movement and animations
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean component-based architecture
- Performance-conscious rendering
- Creative UI inspired by spatial design principles


---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build complex interactive UIs with React
- Integrate 3D graphics into modern web applications
- Translate spatial and design concepts into digital products
